	<b>I finally showered for the first time in two months, and now I’m crying</b><br/>

	<p>I know I’m gross, I know it’s disgusting, but my depression has been so bad for the past months I haven’t been able to get in the shower and do the whole thing.<br/>
	It felt so overwhelming. I would usually wipe myself off with alcohol and wet wipes every day and wear my hair in a bun every day because my hair was so knotted<br/>
	I couldn’t brush through it (not that I would want to because it was just a frizzy oily mess.) But today, I did it.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>I’ve been cleaning all day. My roommate moved out recently, and I have another one moving in and I’ve gotten so much done today. I’m supposed to meet<br/>
	my new roommate in a couple hours to give him the key and help him get situated. I hate the smell of cleaning products and my clothes were covered in them.<br/>
	So I just said “fuck it, it’s time” I took a warm towel out of the dryer and wrapped myself in it while I brushed my hair for the first time in forever,<br/>
	it took almost an hour and I lost so much hair but I haven’t been able to run my fingers through it in months so it was a relief to see I still have<br/>
	most of it on my head. I put on a good video essay to watch and listen to while I’m in the shower and I did the whole damn thing.<br/>
	Washed and conditioned my hair with a deep conditioner, exfoliated my whole body (holy shit there was so much dead skin), scrubbed everything, shaved,<br/>
	did my hair routine that I haven’t done in months.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>I know it’s pathetic and stupid to be proud of myself for something so gross, but I’m crying seeing my curls again for the first time in forever,<br/>
	actually having my hair down, my skin feels soft, and I put on some sweatpants and a t shirt that were still warm from the dryer and it just feels heavenly.<br/>
	I’m typing this with blurry vision from the tears in my eyes and I just wanted to tell someone. No one in my life would understand and they would probably<br/>
	just think I’m insane tbh so I’m just gonna be happy with myself here. I’m gonna go get ready to meet up with my new roommate now.</p><br/>
