Seriously where can i masturbate???


I am a freshman in Binghamton dorms and one of my roommates is an international student who just skips class and plays League of Legends in our room for a literal minimum of
16 hours a day. He even gets his groceries delivered and eats all his meals at his desk so he literally never leaves the room for more than like 5 minutes
(10 minutes if he decides to shower that day). Aside from my room, the only other place that I thought I could masturbate in is the shared bathrooms,
but nutting on the public shower floor just seems so disgusting and heinous. It's been like 3 weeks at this point and I can literally feel a pressure inside my pubic region
whenever I sit down. Does anyone know a place I can go to masturbate? Seriously.
