Two steps ahead.

Two steps ahead. I am always two steps ahead. This has been the greatest social experiment of my entire life. Its alluring. Its compelling. Its gripping.
To observe all these unwell, disoriented beings roam the internet. In search of stories. Ideas. Rivalries. Or they feel encouraged and engaged,
or they involve themselves WITH the stories, and become a product of influence. Thirsty for a distraction, from time unspent, spoiling their minds,
yet still living them at the same time. Its brilliant. And it’s dangerous. I feel as if i am monitoring ants on an ant farm. One, follows another, follows another,
follows another, it’s mesmerizing. Its spellbinding. All these little consumers, all of these lost, and bored, people. People consuming anything that they’re told to consume.
So i AM the villain. Because i’ve made myself one. And you will continue to consume these stories about me, year, after year, after year,
for as long as i tell the internet, that i am the villain. Stories that permeate, and linger, and infect the minds of the ants. Influence the ants.
Brainwash the ants. YOU, are the ants. Today, i woke up from a very long dream, and i also woke up having lost 250 pounds off of my body. Yet just yesterday,
people were calling me fat, and sick, and boring, and irrelevant. People. People are the most messed up creatures on the entire planet. And yet ive still managed
to stay 2 steps ahead, of everyone. The jokes on you.
